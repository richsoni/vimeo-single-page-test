emailed a friend of mine a link to \u2018SAMPLER\u2019 the other day to see what he thought and he texted me back that it was \u2018pretty cool.\u2019 i said \u2018that doesn\u2019t sound very enthusiastic.\u2019 and he wrote back that it was \u2018a little too b sidey for me.\u2019 then the next day he sent a long winded explanation saying he just expected more. i wrote back 'that text leaves me more confused than before, so your saying you were just disappointed? i don\u2019t really care i like it\u2026 it\u2019s b sides whatever i\u2019m not gonna force people to watch it or pay for it so if they\u2019re disappointed then fuck em\u2019 <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nman\u2026 expectations, what a stoke killer. every time you do something, the expectation is that whatever you do next has to be better. do you understand how unsustainable that is? the pressure caused by this principle has stressed me out, burned me out, i eventually cracked, hid out, dropped out, turned away... but then it get\u2019s to a point where you\u2019re just like \u2018fuck it.\u2019 that\u2019s when i\u2019ve done my best surfing. when there is a complete absence of consideration for what people expect. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nso here\u2019s SAMPLER, which is a collection of surfing i\u2019ve done the past year that didn\u2019t make it into \u2018cluster.\u2019 so yeah, it is \u2018b sidey\u2019 but that is not a disclaimer, i\u2019m proud of it. every moment can\u2019t be your best, the waves aren\u2019t always perfect, the more you expect the more your disappointed, do what you can with what you\u2019ve got, surfing\u2019s an art, there\u2019s no winner and no loser, no right or wrong way to do it, there\u2019s a big difference between saying \u2018fuck it\u2019 and genuinely feeling it, and as much as i wish it did, writing it on my boards doesn\u2019t really make me feel it, and i have to say that for the most part, while filming the past year, i was aware that i was one of the oldest guys in the movie with a reputation to defend, and that is not the right frame of mind to surf your best. or feel your best, or be yourself\u2026 but seriously\u2026 fuck it, forget what your sponsors expect, what viewers expect, expect nothing, do your best, clear your mind, be present, turn off, tune out, drop in. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nor as ethan fowler says it \u2018do what you want, do it well, or, if you don\u2019t want to do it well, don\u2019t do it well, just do it how you do it, and that shit shines through a thousand times brighter\u2019<br \/>\r\n<br
